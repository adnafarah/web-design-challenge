# web-design-challenge

In this project, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap 4 were used to create a dashboard featuring analysis of weather data (from a previous project).

The site contains a landing page, 4 visualisation pages, a comparison page & a data page with a table of the data that was visualised. 

Each page has a navigation bar along the top with links to the other pages. Bootstrap 4 was used to make the page responsive, and a CSS stylesheet is used for styling. 

The 'Data' page contains a HTML table - this was converted from a CSV file to a HTML table using Pandas (the code for this can be found in the create_html_table.ipynb file under the Resources folder). The table was then converted to a responsive bootstrap table.
